            	I am a PhD candidate studying Plant Biology. Most of my time is spent asking questions and performing research that explores the evolution of plant shape.  I approach much of my research from a molecular perspective, especially the evolution and regulation of DNA. 

                <p>I also am addicted to learning how to program, especially R, Python, Javascript, and CSS.</p>
