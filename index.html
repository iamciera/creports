            	I am a PhD canidate studying Plant Biology. Most of my time is spent asking questions and performing research that explores the evolution of plant shape.  I approach much of my research from a molecular perspective, especially the evolution and regulation of DNA. 

                <p>I also love learning programming.</p>

            	<p>This site is an exercise in content availability.  As a scientist, I have been very frustrated by the exclusivity of scientific information. This website is my attempt to build my skills at conveying content over this vast digital landscape.</p>
