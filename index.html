			About Me
			</H1>
        	<p>
        	I am a PhD canidate in Plant Biology. Most of my time is spent asking questions and performing research that explores the evolution of plant shape.  I approach much of my research from a molecular perspective, especially the evolution and regulation of DNA. With the increase in DNA sequencing, I have become exposed to large datasets, which have introduced me to the beautiful world of data visulization and programming.  My current motivation is to unite all of these interests with my desire to make information available to anyone interested.

        	<p>This site is an exercise in content availability.  As a scientist, I have been very frustrated by the exclusivity of scientific information. Since I started programming, I have been inspired by the open source community, which has fueled me to make what I do and learn as available as possible.  Since the most important medium for art, science, design, and education is the internet, this website is my attempt to build my skills at conveying content over this vast digital landscape.</p>
