##Pollen tubes stained with aniline blue

I am more interested in vegetative development, but have recently been paying a bit more attention to the part of plants that does not need any more flattery, flowers. I have been really wanting to look closer at how tomato pollination occurs leading me to look at what happens when pollen hits sigma, the foreplay on the road to fertilization, yes sex.  I have been very excited this week as we have just gotten a few new filters on our dissecting microscope allowing visualization of pollen germination directly on the plant in the most beautiful way.

###Pollen

Pollen grains come from a male part of a flower, the anther.  When the pollen grain comes in contact with the female stigma, the pollen gain starts to elongates creating the [pollen tube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen_tube), which travels down the long style where it will finally reach the ovary and fertilization occurs. One of the most fascinating aspects of pollen tube development is that the pollen tube is a single cell. The pollen tube does not grow by cellular division, but rather by elongating at one end. Many plant scientists take advantage of this pollen tubes as a system to explore because 1. the pollen tube length 2. how quickly pollen tubes grow 3. the polar (one side of the cell) nature of the growth.  

 What the aniline blue is staining the [callose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callose) in the pollen tubes. Pollen tubes often have callose plugs, which are the spots you see in the diagram. In all flower plants, the pollen tubes form pollen plugs.   They are believed to act by cutting the older parts of the pollen tube from the newly growing tip, possible increasing  growth rate of the pollen tube down to the ovaries, but it is still largely unknown the exact biological function.


##Stem stained with calcoflour

[Calcoflour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcofluor-white) is used to visualize the cell walls of plants by staining a huge component of plant cell walls, [cellulose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose).

I have been doing some histology of the stem and the [shoot apical meristem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meristem#Shoot_apical_meristems) recently and could not resist staining a few of the slides with calcoflour since we just got the DAPI filter installed. I still have to get the stain time and calcofluor dilution optimized, but if there is one thing I learned, it is that this stain gives an extremely strong signal using a very diluted amount.  


#Thanks!

I am excited to analyze the results from all the samples that were collected this summer by my previous undergraduate intern Gillie Ish-Shalom and our lab technician Sharon Zimmerman. Also, special thanks to the [Tomato Genetics Resource Center](http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/) and Carlos de le Cruz from the Davis Microscope Facility for helping me set-up our microscope.

This is the protocol I used.  The only significant difference is I used plain ol' Aniline Blue, not the Fluorochrome Aniline Blue.
