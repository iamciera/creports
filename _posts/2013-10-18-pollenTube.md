title: New microscope filters
---

I am more interested in vegetative development, but have recently been paying a bit more attention to the part of plants that does not need any more flattery, flowers. I have been really wanting to look closer at how tomato pollination occurs leading me to look at what happens when pollen hits sigma, yes sex.  I have been very excited this week as we have just gotten a few new filters on our dissecting microscope allowing visualization of pollen germination directly on the plant in the most beautiful way.

I am excited to analyze the results from all the samples that were collected this summer by my previous intern Gillie Ish-Shalom and our lab technician Sharon Zimmerman. Also, special thanks to the Tomato Genetics Resource Center and Carlos de le Cruz (aka Man of Thousand Jokes) at the Davis Microscope Facility for helping me set-up our microscope.

This is the protocol I used.  The only significant difference is I used plain ol' Aniline Blue, not the Fluorochrome Aniline Blue.
