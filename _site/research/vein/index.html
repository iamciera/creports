        	<H1> Understanding the development of vein patterning in domesticated tomato and desert adapted wild relative in response to shade </H1>

		    <p>I was first attracted to leaf vasculature because it stood out as one of the more stunning developmental patterns in leaf development.  The more I learned about veins development, the more I became interested in how incredibly diverse the patterning strategies are in veins.  The characteristics I became most interested in was vein density. 
		    </p>

		    <p>
		    Vein density refers to how many vasculature strands are present in a given area of a leaf.  Many people have looked at this phenomena in plants and on top of realizing the density.   how the across the plant kingdom I started to develop further questions of why these strategies. <Insert Laweren Sack>.</p>

			<p>Besides being beautiful, what is the function of veins on leafs?  We can split leaf vasculature into three main functions</p>

			<li><strong>How nutrient/sugar transport</strong> :</li>
			<li><strong>Biomechanical Support</strong> :</li>

			<p>We do know that leaf vasculature changes in response to environment.  Where convergent With adaptive strategies There are many really cool studies looking at how leaf vasculature, such as work.  On of my favorite examples is the

    		<H2>Main Questions</H2> 

			<ol>
			<li><p>What are the vascular difference in minor vein density between <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> (domesticated tomato) and desert adapted wild relative <i>Solanum pennellii</i>?</p></li>

			<li><p>Is there a difference in minor vein density between species in response to sun and shade treatments?</p></li>

			<li><p>Are there introgression linesâ€™s between the <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> and <i>Solanum pennellii</i> that explain differences between m82 and penn?</p></li>

			<li><p>Is there a relationship between minor vein density and leaf shape?</p></li>

			<li><p>When in leaf development are the differences between <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> and <i>Solanum pennellii</i> established?
			</ol>

			<H2>High-througput Analysis of Minor Vein Density</H2>

			<p><i>In collaboration with Donnelly West, <a href="http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/people/jbudke/JessicaMBudke/JM_Budke.html"> Jessica Budke</a>, and <a href="http://www-plb.ucdavis.edu/Labs/sinha/TomatoGenome/Outreach.html">The Tomato Interns</a></i>.</p>

			<p>
			 In collaboration with the <a href="http://malooflab.openwetware.org/Julin_Maloof.html">Maloof Lab</a>, which studies shade response, we looked at vein denisty in both <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, <i>Solanum pennellii</i>, and <a href="http://zamir.sgn.cornell.edu/Qtl/il_story.htm"> 76 introgression lines (IL).</a> Basically, each of these lines is mostly the tomoato we eat, <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, but each line has a tiny region that comes from the desert adapted species, <i>Solanum pennellii</i>.  These lines can be used as a tool to further understand the loci involved in regulating vein patterning by finding IL lines that are look differently than <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, giving us a chance to pinpoint the genes involved in these process.
			</p>

			<p>
			In order to answer many of our questions we needed a high-throughput way to measure many leaves. We first cleared and stained the leaves in large batches using a modified freely available protocol from the amazing <a href="https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/Sack/">Lawren Sack lab</a>We used a high definition scanner to scan thousands of leaves.  We then further calculated vein density using a combination of tracing and programs

        	<p>
        	There are significant differences in density between <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> and <i>Solanum pennellii</i>.  Not only are there density differences between species, but the leaves of these species also show a significant correlation between the light treatments, suggesting somehow that the leaves are capable of responding to light.  This makes sense when you think about the main function of leaves: transport of water!

        	<H2>Developmental Timing of Vascular Development</H2>

        	<p>
        	We further are trying to understand if developmental timing and establishment of leaf vasculature to investigate how and when the plant would be responding to light.  We have a great understanding of how leaf vasculature is established, and the first signal to trigger vein differentiation is thought to be my favorite plant hormone, auxin.  To investigate this, we are looking closely on when veins are established and more importantly, trying to find when does vein pattering stop in development between species. Is one species capable of responding to light treatments later in development than the other? Is one species capable of modifying vein density better?  These are questions we are currently asking by using a florescent marker that labels where auxin is present, right before the establishment of the vein, in three tomato species.  This is my favorite part since my previous intern, Gillie Ish-Shalom, and I get to spend a lot of time taking beautiful photos of early vein establishment.
