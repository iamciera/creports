<H1>Auxin Transport by PIN-FORMED1 proteins in Tomato</H1>

<H3><b>Auxin</b></H3>
	
<p>I knew what I wanted to study before I even before I knew anything about plant biology: the evolution of plant shape.  No matter the angle you approach exploring such a topic, you will always end up looking into the plant hormone <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxin">auxin</a>.</p>

<p>Auxin is linked to so many plant developmental processes that it is almost a joke in the plant developmental community. You could almost publish a paper showing lack of auxin triggers a process.  Actually <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19478783">someone did</a>. Everywhere you look auxin presence plays a role in the establishment of how a plant lives, grows, and dies. Even more astounding, not only is auxin involved in all these processes, but often it has been shown that <strong>auxin is directing these processes</strong>.  Scientists are always looking for the start of a process, continually looking for the never ending search the origin. When looking for the first signal in all of my favorite plant developmental process, leaf initiation, vein development, branching, flower initiation, there is see auxin.  Auxin appears to be the trigger signal to virtually all the processes that make plants beautiful, auxin just has to be in the right place and at the right time.</p>

<H3><b>Auxin is transported by PIN-FORMED proteins</b></H3>

<p>It is becoming more accepted to think of auxin acting as like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogen">morphogen</a>. Morphogens act in a concentration and spatial dependent way to signal cells to become a more specialized cell types. There are distinct patterns of auxin localization and auxin concentration throughout the plant.  For instance in leaf developmet auxin flows throughout, making pathways that eventually direct vein formation.  Spots of auxin concentration and more diffuse auxin concentrations act to  specify overall shape.

  One of the keys to understanding how auxin gets to the right place at the right time comes from studying a group of proteins called <i>PIN-FORMED (PIN)</i>.  <i>PIN</i> protein largely determine where auxin is spatially because they are auxin efflux carriers, meaning they determine the transport of auxin <i>out</i> of a cell.  Since auxin is passively taken into a cell, directionality of auxin is largely determined on the direction of auxin out of the cell by these <i>PIN</i> proteins.  They decide direction by preferentially localizing on one side of the cell plasma membrane. </p>

<p>You can see the importance of <i>PIN1</i> transporters by looking at what happens when you knock-out <i>PIN1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plant biology's favorite model organism.</p>

<br>

<p>The <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutant is how the PINs got their name.  The plants produce these "pin-like" structures because auxin is not capable of telling where to induce flower and leaf formation.  You can even induce leaf formation on a <i>pin</i> mutant plant by applying auxin externally to the pin-like structure, as seen in this seminal paper on the influence of auxin on leaf development from the Kuhlemeier Lab (Reinhardt et al, 2000).</p>

<H3><b>Evolution of <i>PIN1</i> function</b></H3>

<p>The story of how <i>PIN</i> proteins, especially <i>PIN1</i> has been studied extensively, but unfortunately, most of the work is in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.  This is sad because PIN proteins are thought to be present in every species in the plant kingdom, yet we don't know how these incredibly important proteins are are functioning in these other plant species.  Understanding how these <i>PIN</i> proteins function in other species will give the us the evolutionary context to understanding how auxin contributes to the great diversity of plant shape in plants.</p>

 <H3><b>My work</b></H3>

<p>1. What is the phylogenetic relationship of <i>PIN1</i> genes across the plant kingdom?</p>

<p>2. There are three <i>PIN1</i>s in tomato, how do they function in tomato? Is there function different/similar to other <i>PIN1</i> in other species?</p>

<p>3. What happens when <i>PIN1</i> function is altered in tomato?  What happens when there is no or reduced <i>PIN1</i> proteins?</p>
