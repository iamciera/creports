<H1> Exploring the molecular mechanisms that regulate stem cell fate in complex leaves </H1>

<h2>Leaves</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant">angiosperm</a> leaf has a conserved function in light capture for photosynthesis, turning light energy to carbohydrates, which is the primary source for food on this planet.  Not only that, but basically the waste process from the photosynthesis process in leaves results in the very air we breath. This should be reason enough to study these amazing organs, but as a developmental biologist I am interestd in leaves for a very different reason, the shape of leaves can be incredible diverse.  How leaf shape diversity is achieved from a molecular perspective is still very much unexplored territory. This project takes advantage of recent technologies to understand how leaf complexity is achieved at a global gene expression level.</p>

<h2>Leaf Complexity</h2>
<p>Leaves are broadly split into two categories, simple and complex, with the complex form showing a multitude of leaflets on the leaf. Most complex leaves have a punctuated growth pattern with regions of leaflet outgrowth interrupted by regions of no outgrowth.  Leaflet outgrowth and blade development occurs at the <strong> Marginal Blastozone Region (MBR)</strong>. 

<h2>Marginal Blastozone</h2>

<p><strong>Functional definition</strong> - Where primary morphogenesis occurs (leaflet outgrowth)</p>

<p><strong>Histological definition</strong> - Where meristematic activity occurs (high rates of cell  division)</p>

<p><strong>Mechanistic definition</strong> - Largely unknown</p>

<H2>Approach for uncovering gene expression changes that occur at the MBR</H2>

<H3>RNA-seq</H3>

    <p>Although there is great interest in understanding how the MBR is regulated, a strategy to isolate and analyze these regions has yet to be accomplished. In recent years, sequencing technology has evolved at a rapid pace and gene expression analysis has quickly turned to  <a href"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq">RNAseq analysis</a> to understand gene expression changes.  In RNAseq analysis, RNA is isolated from specific tissue, then converted to cDNA, and Illumina sequencing of these cDNAs, allows global gene expression profiling of the specific tissue. 

<H3>Laser Capture Microdissection</H3>        

    <p>RNAseq analysis combined with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_capture_microdissection">Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM)</a>, allows the ability to isolate and analyze the gene expression profile of tissue regions previously unattainable, like the MBR in small early developing leaves. <em>Solanum lycopersicum</em> (tomato), with its large accessible meristem and young leaf primordia, a recent sequenced genome, and a tomato mutant that has early MBR differentiation, <em>trifoliate</em>, make tomato the perfect system for this project. The combination of these approaches allow the exploration of how cells in these MBR regions maintain competency and differentiate to direct the vast quantity of leaf shape diversity achieved in the plant kingdom.</p>
