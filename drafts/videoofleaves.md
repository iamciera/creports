title: Code and Knitting
---

When I was 19 I had 1.) a disposable income 2.) disposable time and 3.) a wicked obsession with knitting.  This meant I was buying copious amounts of yarn and knitting constantly. That was all in Illinois, where the winters are brutal and knitting armor felt like a need.  Now I live in California and all that I have is a yarn collection that is, well, purty colors on a shelf.

I tried to find ways in which I could refuel my inclination towards knitting.  "I can knit cotton bikinis!" - knitted bikinis are not functional, "I can knit stuffed animals" - I don't want to make something for where the only function is being cute, "I can knit presents for everyone back home" - I am selfish and am only motivated by knitting things for myself. 

That is until programming entered my orbit. The most exciting aspect of programming is the way in which you re-orient your way of thinking about already established parts of your world.  I, unlike many other programmers, am grateful I found programming later in life because of just this.  

Knitting is math heavy, you can approach knitting through math in endless ways. Many people have. Some research into the subject has shown me some really amazing contributions. 

Finding patterns is especially interesting to me, actually it one of the most human drives that we have.  Specifically I am interested in understanding visually aesthetic patterns.  Lately, I have been really inspired by Rune Madsen's course Printing Code.  In this course he takes concepts that you would learn in a design course, grid, colors, typography, act. and incorporates their definitions with programming.
