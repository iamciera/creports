title: Learn Git to become a fearless at programming
---

To new programers and especially people who have been forced to learn programming (ehm, biologists), Git is hard to sell.  I have heard every angle and I was sold immediately, but I still didn't truly embrace it until I learned the lesson that made me need it; Git makes you fearless. This is actually ironic because the very reason I didn't dive into Git is because I was not fearless. I never wanted to mess something up.

I think this is one of the main reasons people have a slow learning curve in programming, that people are scared that they will mess something up.  Which is completely warranted considering the two main things people say about programming, 1. programing is incredibly powerful 2. programming is hard, in which the natural response is to be careful.
