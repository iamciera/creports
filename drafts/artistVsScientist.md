This is an extremely complex topic, but incredibly fun to think about. If there is just one thing I am sure on, it is that scientists and artists, manually, do many time act very similar.  

First of all, generalizing an artist and a scientist is absurd. Defining art, impossible. Defining science, a little easier to grasp, but still.  In my mind, science is projects which are approached with the scientific method.  Although science does not need to be in the linear path of the scientific method (observation, hypothesis, testing, analysis, conclusions), somewhere when performing science, you are in this path and at some path you have all the parts. 

Art can be made using any of the steps in scientific methods, and often is.  The main difference is art does not require acting upon the scientific method.  Any science project has the objective of the question being asked.  Art does not require any function.
