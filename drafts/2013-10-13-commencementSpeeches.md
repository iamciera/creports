###Commencement Speeches
I have to admit, I am a sucker for inspirational rhetoric.  I like learning about ways in which people gain motivation. I was recently sent this speech from my father.  Call it the hipster in me (I guess everything is hipster though), but digging a little deeper, I love the self aware commencement speech. 

I am straight link to my the two examples that led me down this though. 


[Tim Minchin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoEezZD71sc#t=579)

>"Please don't make the mistake of thinking the arts and sciences are are at at odds with one another.  That is recent, stupid, and damaging idea. You don't have to be unscientific to make beautiful art, to write beautiful thingsâ€¦You don't need to be superstitious to be a poet.  You don't need to hate GM technology to care about the beauty of the planet. You don't have to claim a soul to promote compassion." 

>"Science is not a body of knowledge, nor a belief system, it is just a term which describes humankind's incremental acquisition of understanding through observation. Science is awesome. The arts and sciences need to work together to improve how science is communicated."
