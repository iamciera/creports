<H1> Understanding the development of vein patterning in domesticated tomato and desert adapted wild relatives in response to stimulated shade </H1>

<h3><b>Plant veins</b></h3>

<p>I was first attracted to veins in leaves because it stood out as one of the more stunning developmental patterns in leaf development.  In addition to beauty, veins are also compelling from an evolutionary perspective; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_plant">the acquisition of veins</a> allowed plants to colonize land.  Just as animals moved from the sea with the adaptation of lungs, one of the main features that allowed the colonization of land by plant was vascular development. The more I learned the more I found myself becoming increasing interested in vein patterning, especially the different strategies to vein archectural patterns.  Which led me to start researching vein density.  Vein density refers to how many vein strands are present in a given area of a leaf and vein density varies considerably across the plant kingdom. But why?</p>

So what is the function of veins in plants?  We can split leaf vein function into three main areas:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Water Transport</strong> : Through the xylem tissue.</li>
<li><strong>Nutrient/sugar transport</strong> : Through the phloem</li>
<li><strong>Biomechanical Support</strong> : The veins provide almost a skeletal network providing a flexible support system for other parts of the plant. </li>
</ol> 

<p>

<h3><b>What sort of influence would vein density have on a plant?</b></h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Some believe that higher vein density allows a plant to have more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma">stomata</a> per given area.  Stomata are pores which are all over the leaf allowing gas exchange, basically allowing the plant to breath. The rate of gas exchange is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomatal_conductance">stomatal conductance</a>, and many studies have found a correlation between vein density and stomatal conductance, where leaves with more vein density have higher stomatal conductance. (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.12253/full">Sack and Scoffoni, 2013</a>)</p></li> 

<li><p>More veins could also mean greater rate of food transport (nutrients and sugar).</p></li>

<li><p>Higher vein density could also lead to greater protection from herbivory damage.  You could think of the vein network as a highway system.  If a road becomes blocked traffic will naturally start to use other routes. The more routes, the less chance traffic problems will arise by the closure of blocked roads.
</p> 

<li><p>One of the more interesting hypothesis is when you think about it in the opposite way.  Is there a benefit to low vein density? Are there environmental factors that favor adaptation by vein density?

<p>We are just beginning to understand how leaf vein density changes in response to environment.  One environmental in particular has been of great interest to our research group: <a href"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade_avoidance">shade avoidance</a>.  Shade avoidance is the mechanism in which a plant responds to neighboring plants.  Since plants are competing for light resources, they have adapted in many ways to respond to this competition, many times responding by increasing plant height through internode elongation and an increase in apical dominance.  Our lab is especially interested in changes in leaf development in response to shade and have recently found that tomato leaves can respond to stimulated shade by by increasing leaf blade area.

<H2>System</H2> 

The system we are using is the domesticated tomato (<i>Solanum lycoperiscum</i>) and closely related wild relatives that have adapted to drastically different ecosystems.  I have focused on a desert adapted species <i>Solanum pennellii</i>, which in addition to growing in a drastically different environment from domesticated tomato, has difference in leaf shape and size and as we are beginning to uncover, vein density.  

<H2>Main Questions</H2> 

<ol>
<li><p>What are the vascular difference in minor vein density between <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> (domesticated tomato) and desert adapted wild relative <i>Solanum pennellii</i>?</p></li>

<li><p>Is there a difference in minor vein density between species in response to sun and shade treatments?</p></li>

<li><p>Are there introgression linesâ€™s between the <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> and <i>Solanum pennellii</i> that explain differences between m82 and penn?</p></li>

<li><p>Is there a relationship between minor vein density and leaf shape?</p></li>

<li><p>When in leaf development are the differences between <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> and <i>Solanum pennellii</i> established?
</ol>

<H2>High-througput Analysis of Minor Vein Density</H2>

<p><i>In collaboration with Donnelly West, <a href="http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/people/jbudke/JessicaMBudke/JM_Budke.html"> Jessica Budke</a>, and <a href="http://www-plb.ucdavis.edu/Labs/sinha/TomatoGenome/Outreach.html">The Tomato Interns</a></i>.</p>

<p>
 In collaboration with the <a href="http://malooflab.openwetware.org/Julin_Maloof.html">Maloof Lab</a>, which studies shade response, we looked at vein denisty in both <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, <i>Solanum pennellii</i>, and <a href="http://zamir.sgn.cornell.edu/Qtl/il_story.htm"> 76 introgression lines (IL).</a> Basically, each of these lines is mostly the tomoato we eat, <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, but each line has a tiny region that comes from the desert adapted species, <i>Solanum pennellii</i>.  These lines can be used as a tool to further understand the loci involved in regulating vein patterning by finding IL lines that are look differently than <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, giving us a chance to pinpoint the genes involved in these process.

<p>
In order to answer many of our questions we needed a high-throughput way to measure many leaves. We first cleared and stained the leaves in large batches using a modified freely available protocol from the amazing <a href="https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/Sack/">Lawren Sack lab</a>We used a high definition scanner to scan thousands of leaves.  We then further calculated vein density using a combination of tracing and programs

<p>
There are significant differences in density between <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> and <i>Solanum pennellii</i>.  Not only are there density differences between species, but the leaves of these species also show a significant correlation between the light treatments, suggesting somehow that the leaves are capable of responding to light.  This makes sense when you think about the main function of leaves: transport of water!  
</p> 

<H2>Developmental Timing of Vascular Development</H2>

<p>
We further are trying to understand if developmental timing and establishment of leaf veins to investigate how and when the plant would be responding to shade.  Scientific have a great understanding of how leaf vasculature is established, and the first signal to trigger vein differentiation is thought to be my favorite plant hormone, auxin.  To investigate this, we are looking closely on when veins are established and more importantly, trying to find when does vein pattering stop in development between species. Is one species capable of responding to light treatments later in development than the other? Is one species capable of modifying vein density better?  These are questions we are currently asking by using a florescent marker that labels where auxin is present, right before the establishment of the vein, in three tomato species.  This is my favorite part since my previous intern, Gillie Ish-Shalom, and I get to spend a lot of time taking beautiful photos of early vein establishment.
