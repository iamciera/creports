          <h1>Research Background</h1>
                <p>
                I have always been fascinated with the design of life forms. My interest began purely from an artistic perspective; drawing, photography, and collecting scientific illustrations. The more I learned about evolutionary process the more I became obsessed with the concept that the form of an organism is the visual representation of eons of struggle, death, and survival. It is this concept that will forever be at the root of my scientific interests.</p>

                <p>Of all forms found in nature, I find plant architecture to be endlessly captivating, both aesthetically and scientifically. I have been following this curiosity for around 5 years, which has sent me all over the country. Where I worked on projects ranging from phylogenetics of diversity hotspots to the evolution bilateral symmetry in flowers. I like to think of scientific questions from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology">evo-devo</a> context, which has been an underling theme in all of my research.</p>

                <p>I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://biosci3.ucdavis.edu/gradGroups/pb/">Plant Biology Graduate Group</a> at University of California, Davis. I work in the <a href="http://www-plb.ucdavis.edu/labs/sinha/">Sinha lab</a>, which focuses on the developmental and evolution of leaf shape. I am currently involved in several projects which all focus on the molecular mechinisms regulatingleaf complexity and initiation.</p>
