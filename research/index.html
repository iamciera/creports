        My research aims to understand the evolution and regulation of development. I do comparative work between species to explain the mechanisms guiding the diversity of plant and animal morphology observed on this planet. My previous work explored how cells fate is determined and maintained during plant development. Through this work, I fell in love with genomics and programming and became entranced by non-coding regions of a genome. Non-coding regions make a significant portion of eukaryotic and we are just beginning to understand how non-coding regions function in controlling developmental and evolutionary processes. As a postdoctoral researcher, I now research a particular type of non-coding region, enhancers. I use <i>Drosophila</i> as a system, to explore how enhancers are architecturally defined and the evolutionary forces and constraints guiding enhancer divergence between species.</p>
