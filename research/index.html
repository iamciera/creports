        I have always been fascinated with the biological design of life forms. My interest began purely from an artistic perspective; drawing, photography, and collecting scientific illustrations. The more I learned about evolutionary processes, the more I became obsessed with the concept that the form of an organism is the visual representation of eons of struggle, death, and survival. It is this concept that will forever be at the root of my scientific interests.</p>
