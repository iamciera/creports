        I have always been fascinated with the design of life forms. My interest began purely from an artistic perspective; drawing, photography, and collecting scientific illustrations. The more I learned about evolutionary process the more I became obsessed with the concept that the form of an organism is the visual representation of eons of struggle, death, and survival. It is this concept that will forever be at the root of my scientific interests.</p>

        <p>Of all forms found in nature, I find plant architecture to be endlessly captivating, both aesthetically and scientifically. I like to think of scientific questions from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology">evo-devo</a> context, which has been an underling theme in all of my research.</p>

        <p>I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://biosci3.ucdavis.edu/gradGroups/pb/">Plant Biology Graduate Group</a> at University of California, Davis. I work in the <a href="http://www-plb.ucdavis.edu/labs/sinha/">Sinha lab</a>, which focuses on the developmental and evolution of leaf shape. I am currently involved in several projects which all focus on the molecular mechanisms regulating leaf complexity and initiation.</p>

       <!--  <p>I have been a little embarrassed about how bad scientist, including myself, are at explaining their work. So in an attempt to remedy this I have put together some information on the specifics of my research. If you are interested in my field please check out the projects, which include some background about some of the projects I am working on, with plenty of resources to delve deeper!</p>  -->
