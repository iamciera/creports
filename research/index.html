        My research aims to understand the evolution and regulation of development. I do comparative work between species to explain the mechanisms guiding the diversity of plant and animal morphology observed on this planet. My previous work explored how cells fate is determined and maintained during leaf, wood, and flower development. During this work I fell in love with genomics and programming and became entranced by the non-coding regions of a genome. These regions make up most of the content of a genome sequence and we are just beginning to understand these regions function in controlling developmental and evolutionary processes. As a postdoctoral researcher, I now research a particular type of non-coding region, enhancers, which function in directing the coding regions (genes). I am fascinated with how these enhancers are architecturally defined and the evolutionary forces and constraints guiding enhancer divergence between species.</p>
