        <H1>Auxin Transport by PIN-FORMED1 proteins in Tomato</H1>

        <H3><b>Auxin</b></H3>
       	
        <p>I knew what I wanted to study before I even before I knew anything about plant biology: the evolution of plant shape.  No matter the angle you approach asking such questions, you will always end up looking into the plant hormone auxin.</p>

        <p>Auxin is linked to so many plant developmental processes that it become almost a joke in the plant developmental community. You could almost publish a paper showing that there is no auxin contribution to a process.  Everywhere you look auxin is playing a role in establishing how a plant lives, grows, and dies. Even more astounding is that auxin is not only is involved in these processes, but often it has been shown that auxin is directing these processes.  Scientists are always looking for the start of a process or continually looking for the origin. When looking for the first signal in all of my favorite plant developmental process, leaf initiation, vein development, branching, flower initiation, you see auxin.  Auxin is the trigger signal to virtually all the processes that make plants beautiful, auxin just has to be in the right place and at the right time.</p>

        <H3><b>Auxin is transported by PIN-FORMED proteins</b></H3>
      
        <p>One of the keys to understanding how auxin gets to the right place at the right time comes from studying a group of proteins called <i>PIN-FORMED (PIN)</i>.  PIN protein largely determine where auxin is spatially because they are auxin efflux carriers, meaning they determine the transport of auxin <i>out</i> of a cell.  Since auxin is passively taken into a cell, directionality of auxin is largely determined on the direction of auxin out of the cell by these PIN proteins.  They decide direction by preferentially localizing on one side of the cell plasma membrane. </p>

        <p>You can see the importance of <i>PIN</i>i transporters by looking at what happens when you knock-out <i>PIN1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plant biology's favorite model organism.</p>

        <p>The <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutant is how the PINs got their name.  The plants produce these "pin-like" structures because auxin is not capable of telling where to induce flower and leaf formation.  You can even induce leaf formation on a <i>pin</i> mutant plant by applying auxin externally to the pin-like structure, as seen in this seminal paper on the influence of auxin on leaf development from the Kuhlemeier Lab (Reinhardt et al, 2000).</p>

        <H3><b>Evolution of PIN1 function</b></H3>

        <p>The story of how PIN proteins, especially PIN1 has been studied extensively, but unfortunately, most of the work is in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.  This is sad because PIN proteins are thought to be present in every species in the plant kingdom, yet we don't know how these incredibly important proteins are are functioning in these other plant species.  Understanding how these PIN proteins function in other species will give the us the evolutionary context to understanding how auxin contributes to the great diversity of plant shape in plants.</p>
